>Time

Sets the mode for what time of day it is:
- Automatic
- Day
- Night

>Day Start 

The hour when day begins (24-hour format)

>Night Start

The hour when night begins (24-hour format)

>Day Brightness

Brightness level during the day, between 0 and 50.

>Night Brightness

Brightness level during night, between 0 and 50. Please be aware a setting of 0 is the equivalent of no moonlight, requiring dynamic lights for proper navigation.

>Startup Message

If checked, sends a game-message reminder if you don't have 117 HD enabled on start-up.

>Color Settings

Choose the color for the day/night skybox/fog. Please keep in mind that the dynamic skybox option overrides the Day Color when the 117 HD plugin is enabled.

>Use Dynamic Daytime Sky

If checked, use the dynamic 117HD sky for daytime when possible. Uses your custom sky color when disabled.



## Future Tasks:
- Add gradual dusk and dawn settings, with skybox color changes if possible.
- ~~Allow for custom skybox day/night color picking~~ Introduced!
- Add option to disable time of day underground.
